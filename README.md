# NAHEO-Enhanced-Neuro-Adaptive-Hybrid-Energy-Orchestrator
NAHEO is a hierarchical, multi-agent control system designed to optimize energy  consumption in battery-operated Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). It replaces traditional  "Always-On" or "Timer-Based" control with a cognitive architecture that learns user patterns,  predicts energy needs, and executes control actions with minimal waste.
